# Train Station Schedule System 

Final university project creating a system for keeping track of Train Station Schedule for Algorithms & Programming course. Main goal - Creating a dynamic data structure - doubly linked list in C.

## About 

A program, that represents the train schedule of the Odesa-Holovna railway station has been developed. A doubly-linked list containing information on train timetables has been implemented: destination station; train number; departure time; arrival time at destination station; cost of the ticket. Output of information about the train schedule is done in a pseudo-tabular format. The ability to add, update, delete, and search train records is provided. Implemented sorting by time of departure.

## Main functionality

* adding new trains to the schedule, inputs: train number, arrival and departure time, price of the ticket, destination;
* editing existing train records to update information;
* deleting trains from the schedule (by number and station of arrival);
* searching for trains by various criteria, for example, by train number or destination;
* displaying the train schedule sorted by departure time (a bubble sorting algorithm was used).

## Additional functionality
* developed a system that keeps track of users, saving their name, username, password, age, and role;
* implemented a feature that saves information about trains` records, according to the user.
